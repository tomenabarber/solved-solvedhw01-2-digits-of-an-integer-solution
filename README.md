Write an app that inputs one number consisting of five digits from the user, separates the number into its individual digits and displays the digits separated from one another by three spaces each. For example, if the user types in the number “42339”, the app should display

4 2 3 3 9

Assume that the user enters the correct number of digits. What happens when you execute the app and type a number with more than five digits? What happens when you execute the app and type a number with fewer than five digits? [Hint: It’s possible to do this exercise with the techniquesyou learned in this chapter. You’ll need to use both division and remainder operations to “pick off ” each digit.]
